<h2 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h2>

<h3 id="sept-2011-present-lead-developer-at-duedil-limited-london">Sept 2011 – present: Lead Developer at DueDil Limited, London</h3>

<p>Wearer of Many Hats. Progressed through several roles as lead developer, team lead and senior architect, shifting as needed during company growth from seed-stage startup to growth-stage enterprise SaaS.</p>

<h4 id="data-access-layer">Data Access Layer</h4>

<p>Most recently I conceived, designed and led the development of a GraphQL schema and server (2017-2019):</p>

<ul>
<li>Instigated project to tackle persistent issues that arose from having multiple client applications using heterogeneous databases and services.</li>
<li>Problems addressed include: code complexity and duplication, development speed, data presentation consistency, inefficiency, high cost of change and preparation for international data expansion.</li>
<li>Led a small team to successfully implement the project, support migration and manage ongoing data evolution.</li>
<li>Immediately successful as foundation for a new commercial API version – enabling one of the best combinations of time-to-market, ROI and low maintenance cost in the company&rsquo;s product history.</li>
<li>Tackled remaining performance challenges by iteratively developing novel GraphQL AST analysis techniques and a multi-pass control-graph execution engine, allowing targeted high-performance strategies when appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="development-efficiency">Development Efficiency</h4>

<p>I continually supported other teams with utilities to assist feature development and developer productivity (2013-2019). Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go-to team expert for debugging and cross-system triage.</li>
<li>In-house Elasticsearch query-building abstraction library. A prelude to the GraphQL project, this isolated app layers from Elasticsearch specifics, allowing faster and safer data restructuring, smoother Elasticsearch version upgrades and significant performance gains.</li>
<li>Various performance analysis and regression-testing tools: traffic replay, load simulations, head-to-head benchmarking of development branches, instrumentation and experimental-codepath execution.</li>
<li>Reverse proxy utility to route webhooks to NAT&rsquo;d developer environments.</li>
<li>Caching systems for deep pagination of complex search workloads.</li>
<li>Fast lightweight HTML-to-PDF conversion service (Node, PhantomJS), before chrome headless made it easy.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="data-service-infrastructure">Data &amp; Service Infrastructure</h4>

<p>I contributed to several generations of infrastructure development (2012-2016):</p>

<ul>
<li>Spearheaded adoption of infrastructure automation (initially Chef).</li>
<li>Built dynamic provisioning for first generation of data-processing infrastructure (Chef, AWS, Hadoop, HDFS, Spark), meeting rapidly evolving needs of new data-processing and machine-learning teams.</li>
<li>Led adoption of docker for runtime services, developing and promoting effective best-practices.</li>
<li>Developed microservice deployment atop Mesos/Marathon: defined in-house patterns and built management tools, load-balancing and service discovery via DNS (before it was cool).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="duedil-com-initial-development">Duedil.com Initial Development</h4>

<p>I jointly led the rapid development of the duedil.com web platform (2011-2015):</p>

<ul>
<li>Evolved existing proof-of-concept beta codebase (custom PHP, monolithic) into initial commercial product release.</li>
<li>Managed various iterations of web platform teams through substantial growth:

<ul>
<li>Onboarded developers, defined in-house standards and practices, promoted testing culture and peer review.</li>
<li>Managed team priorities in a fast-changing product development roadmap.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Championed and instigated an incremental migration to modern community-adopted standards, framework and libraries (eg. symfony, composer).</li>
<li>Designed and implemented a fine-grained feature access system with third-party payment integration. This empowered rapid change in the commercial model, including one-off purchases; pre-paid credit; multi-tiered personal subscription plans; and multi-user enterprise licensing.</li>
<li>Led feature development for commercial features, internal prototypes and public promotional projects.</li>
<li>Built bulk database import tools (Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL), in coordination with the new data-processing team.</li>
<li>Implemented CI/CD system to automatically test and host active development branches for review, QA, demos and acceptance testing.</li>
<li>Implemented semi-automatic (manual signoff) blue-green deployment system for production staging, testing, release and rollback.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>End-to-end new feature development for public events, product launches and e-commerce seasonal cycles.</li>
